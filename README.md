# Super-Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Super Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe!

Super Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a fun twist on classic tic-tac-toe.
The playing grid consists of a 3x3 or 5x5 board with each square having its own tic-tac-toe board inside of it. The game can support any amount from 2 to 5 players, and the first person to get 3 in a row in the big grid wins! Other rules are specified in the "Rules" menu in-game. Super Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe also has many smaller features such as a dark mode theme and music.

This game might seem complicated at first, but once you start playing, it gets much more fun!
